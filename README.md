Program to find Greatest Common Denominator through Recursion Method

The program shows that code I used to find the GCD of 8 numbers.First, I took  the required variables:- size, arr, and result. The size variable will hold the number of elements in the array, the arr variable represents the array, and the result variable will hold the final result.

Then I created an object of the Scanner class to read input values from the end-user. The array size should be taken before declaring the array. After declaring the array, take numbers i.e. elements of the array. The first number will be assigned to the result variable. Now, use the loop to repeat the process, and calculated the result by repeatedly taking the GCD of pairs of numbers. In the output it asked for the total numbers, which was 8, then I entered the numbers, and the greatest common denominator is 2.
